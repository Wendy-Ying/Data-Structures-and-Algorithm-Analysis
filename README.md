# Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis
## lab homework
Our lab assignments focused on the use of classical data structure algorithms, and required low time complexity, thoroughness of consideration, and needed to be validated on ONLINE JUDGEMENT to ensure the reliability of the algorithms, which I passed with perfect scores on all of my assignments.

## project
Our course project produced an intelligent image scaling system based on seam-carving algorithm. It is able to add and remove pixels for similar regions in an image based on user input to achieve elegant image scaling. It also supports the user to select regions of interest and regions of disinterest to customize the image scaling.

In the project, I was responsible for writing and testing all the code for the GUI, collaborating on module communication between front-end and back-end functions, and writing reports.
